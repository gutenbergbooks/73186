</div>


<p>The purpose of this little book is to
show that one, at least, of the gods of
Hellas has survived the flood which
swept away the most entertaining company
of gods and goddesses ever
created by man’s imagination. As I
propose to set him in the august place
vacated by the death of Zeus, a few
biographical details may not be out of
place.</p>

<p>Hephæstus was the son of Hera
(Juno), but not of Zeus (Jupiter).
How his mother put him into the
world is not precisely known. Neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
Zeus nor any other male god had anything
to do with it. Yet it would be
inappropriate in the case of such a
confirmed matron as Hera to speak of
parthenogenesis. Some extraordinary
event had to take place before the
great home-goddess could be driven
to spite her lord and master by producing
a son without his co-operation.
And such an event had indeed occurred,
for Zeus had suddenly reverted
to one of the oldest forms of propagation
known to biology, <i>viz.</i>, propagation
by budding. A fully-armed young
goddess, severe of countenance and
lithe of limb, had sprung forth from
his head, thenceforth and for ever to
lead and dominate the world of
thought. It was up to Hera to match
Pallas Athene by some equally important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
contribution to the evolution
of gods, and so by some mysterious
process, into which Greek historians
did not care to pry, she produced
Hephæstus, whom the Romans called
Vulcan, now the only surviving representative
of that lively and enterprising
clan which once ruled the world
from the summit of Mount Olympus.</p>

<p>Like many another product of
inspiration, Hephæstus was at first
regarded as a failure. He was undersized
and weak-chested, and Hera
had to suffer much from the gibes of
her peers and peeresses. So one day
she dropped him down the slope of
the mountain and he fell into the sea.
He was picked up by two of those
charming and motherly sea-goddesses
which at that time abounded in sea-water,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
and was brought up in a grotto
under the ocean. In return for their
kindnesses he made them pretty
ornaments of coral and mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>At the age of ten, or thereabouts,
he set out to find his mother. It was
some time before Hera recognized in
the lame boy, with the spinal curvature
and the swarthy but pleasant face,
the child she had so mercilessly cast
off. But a spark of mother-instinct
revived under the flame of the child’s
filial devotion, and they soon became
lasting friends and allies.</p>

<p>Hephæstus, naturally, owed no
allegiance to Zeus, and in the frequent
marital disputes between him and
Hera he invariably took his mother’s
part, and so successfully that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
redoubtable Father of the Gods took
him by his lame leg and flung him
into space. He fell for a whole day<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and eventually alighted, like a
meteorite, on the island of Lemnos,
where he was worshipped as many a
meteorite has been worshipped before
and since. He put up with this for a
while, but the blood of the Olympians
asserted itself, and he painfully
climbed home once more. This time he
succeeded in planting his unequal feet
firmly on his native rock, and he soon
became a favourite among his divine
relations. He undertook the reconstruction
of the Olympian dwellings,
and for this purpose established a
wonderful workshop with a huge anvil<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
and twenty bellows, all of which would
work at his mere behest. The workshop
was made of fire-proof materials,
and shone “like a star in the night.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> This must be a mistake, as it would put
the summit of Olympus somewhere beyond the
orbit of the moon.</p>

</div>

<p>He solved the housing question by
building a separate palace for each of
the gods and goddesses, replete with
all the comforts and refinements of
civilization. Nor did his amiability
end there. Sometimes, at their daily
assemblies, he would give Ganymede
a day off and would himself hand
round the nectar, producing roars of
laughter by the contrast between his
hobbling gait and the deportment of
the graceful young cup-bearer.</p>

<p>He became so popular that at last
he was able to marry Aphrodite herself,
the goddess of Love and Beauty,
whom the Romans called Venus, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
who was born of the foam of the sea
somewhere off Cyprus. But this union
of Beauty and the Beast was far from
being a happy one. Venus was not
satisfied with a “lame mechanic” as
she called him, and hankered after
the dashing Ares, alias Mars, the god
of war. Having been warned by
Helios, the sun-god, of the progress
of the intrigue—after it had already
reached its climax—Hephæstus lay in
wait for the guilty pair with an invisible
net, and having caught them,
dragged them before the other gods
amid Homeric laughter produced by
their struggles in the invisible meshes.
And when a daughter was born, whom
they miscalled Harmonia, Hephæstus
had his revenge by presenting her
with a necklace which brought disaster<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
to her and all its later possessors
until it was finally laid to rest in the
temple of Athene.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the fame of his works
spread far and wide. King Aetes of
Colchis ordered the construction of
two bronze bulls capable of breathing
fire through their nostrils, and when
Achilles, the Greek champion before
Troy, decided to kill Hector and
avenge his friend Patroclus, he went
to Hephæstus with an introduction
from Thetis, the sea-goddess, and prevailed
upon him to make him a marvellous
shield on which all heaven
and earth were figured in bronze, and
which was quite impervious to mortal
spear and battle-axe.</p>

<p>And so he dwelt and worked on
Olympus for three thousand years or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
so, establishing branch works on Lipari
and in Sicily which kept working at
full blast until Paul of Tarsus came
with his claim to have found the
Unknown God who was to establish
a new Roman dominion to take the
place of the mighty Empire of the
Cæsars, and was incidentally to sweep
away the gods of Rome and Greece
alike and establish the worship of a
tripartite God who never smiled.</p>

<p>So the light-hearted company of
Mount Olympus died, all but
Hephæstus, who hobbled through
many lands seeking a place where he
might work and set his bellows blowing
once more. For centuries he wandered,
despised and jeered at by
monks, hermits, and anchorites. But
his courage never failed him. It survived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
the desolation of the Olympian
palaces as it had survived his two falls
from the summit.</p>

<p>And now he has come back into his
own, and his power is spreading like
a conflagration. The God of Fire is
the supreme master of the earth. His
furnaces are roaring. He has dispelled
the clouds of Asiatic mysticism which
obscured his native mountain. He has
girdled the world with hoops of steel.
He has found strength</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And his victorious progress is only
beginning to take effect. How it has
come about, and what will be the
eventual result of his domination of
our planet, it is the purpose of what
follows to elucidate.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ethnologists believe that the metamorphosis
from beast-like savage to cultured civilian
may be proximately explained as the result of
accumulated changes that found their initial
impulses in a half-a-dozen or so of practical
inventions.</p>
</div>


<p>An Irish poet, disconsolately walking
along Fleet Street one day, bethought
himself of a small island in an Irish
lake, where he could escape from the
noise and bustle of the London streets.
He wrote a lovely poem embodying
that thought, a poem expressing the
longing of every sensitive soul to
retire within itself for a time and reconstruct
its world from within instead
of having it impressed from without.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>Needless to say, he did not content
himself with planting nine beans in
a row, as he had longed to do in his
fit of depression. On the contrary.
He became an Irish statesman and
Senator. He dwelt in surroundings far
removed from the Stone Age. The
very chair on which he sat down to
write owed its existence to many factories
and mechanical processes. Its
wood was derived from planks cut in
the saw mills. Its French polish,
although put on by hand, was made
of constituents—shellac, methylated
spirit, whitening and what not—drawn
from many sources, each involving a
number of ingenious inventions. The
coal which made his fire had been
brought across the sea by a steamer—a
miracle of complicated mechanism—and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
the shovel with which he put it on
had been mined in Belgium, smelted
in Germany, rolled in Sheffield, and
shaped and finished in Birmingham.</p>

<p>Not that “Inishfree” was but an
idle dream. There are many such
islands in Ireland, peopled by men
and women and children, living in
one-roomed mud hovels on potatoes
and stewed tea, infested with vermin
and ravaged by tuberculosis and other
infectious diseases, people who, if they
cannot emigrate, suffer their fate with
a stolid and pathetic resignation relieved
by the hope of heavenly compensation
hereafter.</p>

<p>Such is Inishfree, stripped of its
glamour and shown in its naked
reality.</p>

<p>Savagery does not mean simplicity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
but complexity, not peace but constant
dread, not health but hopeless disease
and premature death. The South
American Indian suffers acutely from
constipation, which is about the last
disease we should expect him to suffer
from. The negro in his native Africa
is often horribly deformed through
neglect at birth, neglected injuries, or
the ravages of insect pests.</p>

<p>It has taken mankind ten thousand
years to emerge from savagery into
barbarism, and from barbarism into
civilization. Nor is the process yet
completed. The mass of mankind is
still grossly ignorant. But the leaven
of knowledge is steadily working and
pervading the mass, and the rate of
progress is constantly rising.</p>

<p>Let us trace this wonderful process<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
of civilization to its origins and probe
its essential nature.</p>

<p>Starting somewhere in the tropics as
a diminutive “sport” allied to the
arboreal ape, man learned to use tools
and weapons. This was the first step
taken towards the conquest of the
animal world, his natural enemies.</p>

<p>We do not know how many ages
elapsed before the rough stone hammer
evolved into the axe of polished flint.
In any case, the rough stone, even if
only used for throwing at his enemy
or killing his prey, was an essentially
new departure in evolution, and
sounded the keynote to all that followed
down to our own times.</p>

<p>Tools and weapons had been evolved
by other animals, but they were always
organically connected with their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
bodies. The tiger’s claws and teeth,
the tusks of the elephant and the wild
boar, the beak of the eagle were all
formidable weapons and useful tools,
but they could neither be detached,
nor replaced, nor exchanged for other
tools more suitable to the occasion.
Those “natural” tools and weapons
had all been produced by “evolution,”
in other words, by a mysterious agency
which some call God, some Adaptation,
and some the Urge of Life.</p>

<p>Who was that audacious man who
first took upon himself the divine
privilege of making tools and weapons
for himself, instead of waiting for
“nature” to provide them for him?</p>

<p>Perhaps he was a puny boy, lame
from birth and unable to escape from
the boar who was pursuing him. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
the extremity of his terror he took up
a heavy stone from the ground and
flung it at the boar with all his might.
The boar, we may well imagine, was
dazed and probably terrified by this
unusual method of defence, and slunk
away from his feeble but resourceful
antagonist. The story of that deliverance
may, for all we know, have been
sung for many generations in the tribe,
and who knows but that the boy grew
up into a great red-haired man, as
great an adept at stone-throwing as the
street-urchins in Belfast, and formed
the prototype of the God Thor, whose
hammer, when thrown, returned to his
hand of its own accord.</p>

<p>But the essential step was taken.
The lad had no teeth or claws which
could match the solid tusks wielded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
by his mighty antagonist. So he “invented”
a new weapon. He did not
grow it in his own organism, as the
squid grows its ink, to be used on one
occasion and then gradually renewed.
He took a piece of the outside world
and made it temporarily a part of his
person, a part which could be detached
and resumed at a moment’s notice, a
temporary attachment or extension of
his body which required no blood-vessels
to keep it in repair and which,
if broken or injured, would inflict no
pain upon himself.</p>

<p>This great innovation may have
been aided by some analogies in the
animal world. A bird had to collect
twigs and leaves in order to build a
nest, and had thus to put a portion of
the “outside world” to its own uses.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Besides, the very process of eating involved
the apprehension of outside
objects, an apprehension which, in the
case of the lowest form of animal life,
is to this day accomplished by pouring
its jelly-like body round the object to
be consumed.</p>

<p>But the next invention, the discovery
of the use of fire, was a departure
without a parallel to anything in the
kingdoms of Nature. It placed mankind
by a single act in a position of god-like
authority over the living world.
It is not surprising that the discovery
of fire is surrounded by countless
legends. In Greek mythology the first
use of fire is attributed to Prometheus,
the Fore-Thinker, the man who thinks
ahead. He stole it from the heavens,
and was punished by Zeus with terrible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
torment for having dared to endow
mankind with a divine privilege.</p>

<p>How great the privilege was we
cannot even yet realize. For the uses
of fire are by no means exhausted, and
are multiplying from day to day. But
the essential element of the change
was that something came into the
hands of man which did not exist in
“Nature” at all, not, at least, in a
manner ordinarily accessible to organic
being. It was quite “unnatural” to use
fire. Fire represented a state in which
no organism could survive, in which all
its functions were ruthlessly stopped,
and its living tissues destroyed. No
animal except man has ever attained
to the use of fire. Its use represents
the transcendence of man from the
ordinary scheme of Nature and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
ascent into a sort of supernatural, or
at least super-organic realm.</p>

<p>From this step there has been no retreat,
and there can be no retreat until
the sun itself grows cold. Whatever
our “back-to-Nature” cranks may say,
mankind cannot repudiate and renounce
its most precious acquisition and all
that it involves in the present and the
future. We may dislike the smoke of
blast-furnaces, but the remedy is not
to do away with them, but to stop their
smoking. The bellows of Hephæstus
are blowing and his fires are burning.
The age of machinery, begun in far-off
Palæolithic days, but only established
within the last hundred years
or so, has now gripped us in a scheme
from which none may escape.</p>

<p>Taken in its narrower sense, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
word “machine” means a contrivance
for increasing the force we can bring
to bear upon objects until it exceeds
the limits imposed upon the tension of
our muscles. As most of the 400
voluntary muscles of the human body
are attached to the bones in a manner
which diminishes the force exerted below
the actual tension of the muscles,
the adoption of machinery constitutes
a reversal of the “natural” use of the
system of levers which we call our
skeleton. The Lever, the Inclined
Plane, the Wedge, the Pulley, the
Wheel and Axle, and the Screw, are
all contrivances for slowing down the
rate of work until the force required
to perform it comes within the compass
of our muscles. Our bones, on the
other hand, are mostly levers “of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
third order,” in which the force is applied
between the fulcrum and the object
to be moved. Thus it happens that
in order to lift a weight of one pound,
our muscles are strained by a force which
may amount to as much as six pounds.</p>

<p>We are hardly justified in ascribing
this uneconomic arrangement to the
“stupidity” of Nature. Any other arrangement,
such as the use of levers
of the “second order,” would have
involved a much bulkier and clumsier
build of the muscular system. Nor can
we conceive of the adoption by man
of the Six Machines as a deliberate
imitation of Nature, or an improvement
upon observed natural processes.</p>

<p>The Six Machines are obviously the
crude results of long-continued experience,
and it was not until the middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
of the nineteenth century that their
real significance in the system of
mechanics was recognized.</p>

<p>The real importance of these contrivances
lies in the fact that they increase
the power of the human body
without any further evolution of the
human organism. The adoption of
mechanism was a turning point in
evolution, and an event the significance
of which can only be classed with such
far-reaching innovations as the birth
of life itself or that adoption of locomotion
as an aid to nutrition which
gave rise to the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>The most widely useful of the Six
Machines was undoubtedly the Wedge.
Its use was usually accompanied by
that of the projected stone. The latter,
after being swung by muscular force,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
was a reservoir of energy, which is the
power of performing work. If brought
to rest within a shorter distance than
the curve of the swing, it required a
correspondingly greater force to stop
it. And that force could be still further
increased by applying it to the end of a
wedge whose sides bore upon the object
to be split. The combination of
mass and wedge is represented by the
spear, the arrow, and the sword, while
the hammer and the club acted as
crushers rather than cutters.</p>

<p>Observe, then, this puny but formidable
creature emerging from his
tropical forest. In his hand he carried
the means of annihilating that continuity
of the organism which is essential
to its existence. He was able
to drive a powerful and irresistible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
wedge into the body of his antagonist
and thus end the co-ordination of its
natural functions. It was thus that,
later in history, the Macedonian
phalanx split up the armies of the
Persian kings. By a different but essentially
similar process the 15-inch
naval gun drives a wedge clean through
the armour of its opponent, in the
shape of a shell which does not explode
until it is right inside the enemy ship.</p>

<p>Man’s war of conquest against the
animal world had begun. He brought
to them a death more sudden than had
existed up to his time. For he had
the power of driving his wedge into
the most vulnerable and essential part
of his enemy’s body. A clean cut inflicted
at the appropriate point would
mean his final end. Man was not long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
in discovering his enemy’s weaknesses.
And when his enemy was a human
one, he made assurance complete by
bringing home his head.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> It is curious in this connection that among
the legends of the Saints there is no record of a
decapitated person being brought back to life.
The angels or departed saints who came to
heal the torn breasts of martyred Christian
virgins were unable to put heads back on bleeding
trunks, even though the tongues in some of those
heads were empowered to testify for some time
after they would, in the ordinary course of
things, have become silent for ever.</p>

</div>

<p>If we examine the connection between
man and his weapon we find that
the latter differs from an eagle’s beak
or a tiger’s claw in but one essential
point: it is no longer an integral part of
the organism. It can be detached at
will, and replaced by another weapon.
Its separation or destruction does not
imply an injury to the organism. Man
is not put out of action by losing his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
weapon. He is only reduced to his
original position with respect to his
antagonist. And even that is no irreparable
loss so long as he has other
weapons at his command. Thus the
same step which vastly increased his
offensive power also made him comparatively
immune to attack.</p>

<p>Now, a weapon in a man’s hand, so
long as it is in active use as a weapon,
is a part of the man himself. It is true
that he can lose it without perishing
himself, but he can also lose an arm
or a leg and still survive. The mere
fact that the man’s blood circulates in
his natural leg and not in a wooden
leg he may substitute for it makes no
essential difference. He may kick with
either. And we know that a man’s
leg, like all the cells of his body, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
largely compound of inert matter such
as food products and waste products,
besides being nine-tenths water—an
inorganic substance. A wooden leg,
or any weapon which a man may use,
may therefore be regarded as a limb
of the man’s body, so long, that is, as
it is in active use. And if a “soul”
animates that man’s body and drives
it to perform deeds of valour, the
same soul will animate his weapon.
The soul of the weapon is the soul of
the man who uses it.</p>

<p>There is an increasing tendency in
modern thought to abolish the distinction
between soul and body and to
regard them as one and indivisible.
Adopting that view, we may assert
that the use of a weapon means the
enlargement of a man’s body and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
simultaneous expansion of his soul.
Every weapon, every tool, every machine
is the embodiment of a human
thought and purpose. The user adopts
that thought and purpose, and behold—the
machine has found its soul!</p>

<p class="noic">Man is an animal who laughs and cooks.</p>


<p class="p1">When Prometheus had caught some
sparks from the chariot of the sun and
brought them safely to earth, hidden
in a tube, there was consternation on
Mount Olympus. The Conservative
Government of that privileged stronghold
trembled for its celestial prerogatives.
It was all very well, they said,
for Hephæstus to blow his bellows in
his workshop and produce beautiful
things for Olympians, so long as he
did it under proper supervision. But
fire, once brought to earth, would set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
the whole world ablaze and consume
them in their palaces.</p>

<p>Hephæstus himself was not perturbed.
Remembering the kindness he
met with on Lemnos after his brutal
expulsion from the company of the
gods, he secretly sympathized with
Prometheus and his race, and planned
a closer co-operation with mankind.
His Sicilian workshops saw him oftener
than before, hobbling about among his
furnaces and experimenting with every
kind of ore and ingot. Wherever he
went, whether among gods or men,
his kindness and his merry humour
made him a general favourite.</p>

<p>Although he often made weapons,
he much preferred to make tools and
ornaments. Among the Olympians,
his strangely begotten “sister” Athene<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
was his closest ally. Like him, she
favoured the arts of peace rather than
those of war, and despised the noisy
and swashbuckling Ares. When
Athene went to take up her abode in
her Parthenon at Athens, he forsook
Olympus and removed his furnaces to
Lipari, off the Sicilian coast. And it
was in Sicily, some centuries later, that
his great disciple Archimedes was
born, the man who was fitted and
destined to establish the reign of
Hephæstus in spite of the strenuous
opposition of the Roman republic and
its subsequent imperial and ecclesiastical
successors.</p>

<p>When man was endowed with fire
he received the gift without knowing
whence it came or what it meant.
Greek mythology, with its deep insight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
into unseen things, presents us Helios,
the sun-god, as a friend of Hephæstus,
the god of fire. We moderns express
the same truth differently. We say
that all fire on earth is ultimately
derived from the sun. Archimedes
kindled fires—preferably in Roman
ships—by means of concave mirrors
which condensed the heat of the sun
to a focus. The fuel for the fires was
also provided by the heat of the sun,
absorbed by the chlorophyll of the
leaves in the forest and used to build
up combustible wood and other
products. The firing of the wood
reversed the process of accumulation
of solar energy and provided light and
heat by day and by night, independently
of the sun, the original giver.
For a hundred million years already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
had the sun shone on a habitable earth,
pouring out its light and heat and
nourishing the luxuriant vegetation
which covered most of the globe.
For untold ages had the plants stored
up the sunlight for some unknown
end. That end became manifest when
Prometheus kindled the first fire and
made a new realm accessible to man.
Till then, mankind had undergone the
annual and daily vicissitudes of heat
and cold due to the days and the
seasons, but he had not controlled
them. When he acquired the mastery
of fire, he was enabled to wander
north and south and take with him in
his brazier the accustomed heat of
the tropics.</p>

<p>But there was more to come. The
invention of pottery—another great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
epoch—enabled him to create a solar
furnace on a small scale. It enabled
him to create a miniature world where
the heat was much greater than in his
own world. He soon found that plants
and animals, passed through this new
world, became richer and more palatable,
and in many ways better adapted
to his digestive system. It must have
seemed highly “unnatural” at first to
accelerate the ripening of fruits and
predigest animal food by plunging
them into water in which no living
thing could survive, but the departure
from the habits of the animal world,
once begun, was never arrested, and
it is still proceeding in our own
day.</p>

<p>Our remote progenitors must have
looked upon the guardians of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
fires with much the same awe as that
which mediæval people felt for
sorcerers and alchemists, and with
rather more justification. For man had
everything to learn about the new
power placed in his hands. He was
beginning to find his way about a new
world in which the ordinary laws of
Nature were suspended. Water was
no longer cold and wet in that world.
It was hot as the sun and thin as smoke.
It no longer flowed but rose in the air.
Salt rapidly became invisible in it, but
could as rapidly be recovered by adding
more fire. There was as much to
learn about fire as there was about
X-rays in 1895 and about “atmospherics”
to-day.</p>

<p>The possession of fire turned winter
into summer and night into day. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
lengthened the life-time of its fortunate
possessors. But it did much more
than that. It endowed mankind with
a number of gifts which must, in his
primitive condition, have appeared to
him as supernatural. It gave him
substances which combined the hardness
of stone with the toughness of
wood. It enabled him to mould these
substances into any desired shape by
the softening action of excessive heat.
Hephæstus himself cast his products
in bronze, having cunningly mixed
copper with tin in order to produce an
alloy combining hardness with ductility.
But he and his later disciples found
the perfect substance in iron, which,
though requiring an extreme degree
of heat, yielded weapons and tools of
unsurpassed power and strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>And thus it was that Hephæstus
and his human allies prepared that
career of conquest which eventually
swept over the earth and made all
things new. The unprogressive Zeus,
content with having learnt how to
shake Olympus with a nod of his
head, perished in the flood of new
ideas from the East. Hephæstus,
alone of all that shining company,
had established a firm footing in the
world. For the work of his hands
had trained his brain and enabled it to
build up a scheme of the cosmos in
which every detail corresponded to
some ascertained reality. And so,
while Egyptian priests were speculating
about the weight of a soul, while
Hindu sects were vying with each other
in producing the most hideous idols,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
and while Christian theologians were
endeavouring to prove that three ones
make one, Hephæstus and his followers
were engaged in founding that
superb edifice of knowledge which was
destined to outlast the fall of empires
and the dark ages which followed the
eclipse of classical learning.</p>

<p>But even as late as 1800 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, in
spite of the mariner’s compass, the
printing press, and gunpowder, the
ground won by Hephæstus was very
small. The postal services in Europe
were inferior to that of the Cæsars,
there was no telegraphic system equal
to that of the ancient Persians, and the
most stately sailing ship barely excelled
the classical trireme. The fruits of the
work of Newcomen and Watt and
Papin had not yet blossomed. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
they did come forth, things happened
swiftly. Fire was made to generate
steam, and steam, in the course of a
century, transformed the world. The
motive-power being there, it was put
to a million uses. The Wheel became
the most important of mechanical
contrivances. Now a wheel is a thing
which, in the organic world, is simply
impossible. In the days when microscopes
were of feeble power, it was
thought that the “wheel animalcule,”
called <i>Vorticella</i>, had small wheels
revolving on the rim of its opening to
gather in the floating food particles.
But higher magnifying power showed
that the appearance was an illusion
created by the oscillation of the fine
hairs fixed round the aperture. A
wheel revolving on a shaft implies a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
separation which precludes all organic
connection. Had it been otherwise,
an animal running on its own wheels
would have made its appearance on
earth long ago. The shaft of the
steam engine could be provided with
numerous pulleys, each capable of
driving a machine connected with it by
a belt. Then arose that marvellous
crop of mechanical combinations which
brought about the age of mechanism,
combinations which, in the last resort,
can be reduced to sliding couples and
turning couples, and can be catalogued
by means of formulæ, like words in a
dictionary. So numerous were these
inventions, so widespread was their
use, and so great their effect on the
minds of those generations, that a
great illusion arose which coloured the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
philosophies of a whole century and
has left traces even in modern times.
People became so accustomed to the
perfect functioning of a machine or a
clock, so impressed with its regularity
and intelligible complexity, that they
began to look upon mechanism as a
primary thing capable of “explaining”
many non-mechanical things, not excluding
the phenomena of life. Why
should not man himself, the inventor
of machinery, be a machine? If any
functions of his body seemed beyond
explanation on mechanical lines, might
this not be solely due to their great
complexity?</p>

<p>In a recent article in <cite>Nature</cite>, Professor
Fraser Harris puts the matter
tersely as follows:</p>

<p>“Because the stomach ‘works’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
rhythmically and predictably we may
call it a machine for turning out pepsin
from blood and liken it to a machine
for turning out (say) newspapers, but
the secretion of pepsin is not mechanical,
nor is the output of newspapers
vital.”</p>

<p>The strangest point about the materialistic
or mechanistic conception of
things is that every machine without
exception has an inherent purpose and
design. It is intended by its inventor
to do certain definite things in a certain
definite way. If an animal, therefore,
is a machine, it must have a design
and purpose, and presumably a
designer. But the main idea underlying
the mechanistic hypothesis was
to eliminate the idea of purpose altogether,
and reduce the universe to an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
accidental configuration of lifeless
atoms.</p>

<p>It is difficult to see how this attempt
to reverse the rôle of Potter and Pot
could ever have satisfied enquiring
and well-balanced minds, but it is a
fact that mechanistic views of life,
after a period of almost general acceptance,
are still prevalent among
biologists whose education in the
principles of logic has been somewhat
hurried.</p>

<p>The majority, however, have returned
to the saner view that it is useless
to explain the known by the less
known. Human purpose is a primary
fact of experience, and the embodiment
of a human purpose in a tool or machine
is a process which cannot be denied
on any reasonable grounds. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
a “purpose” is a datum of the mind,
which cannot be reduced to any simpler
elements. The purpose of a machine
is the psychical element embodied in
it. Briefly, we may call it the “soul
of the machine.” Every machine has
a psychical element, a purpose, a
“soul.” It is therefore, simpler, more
in accordance with sound philosophical
principles, more direct and “economical”
to explain machines in terms of
psychology than to explain human
bodies in terms of mechanism.</p>

<p>The victories of Hephæstus are
victories of mind over matter. The
“mechanical age,” which to some
appears as the very negation of the
soul, is, on the contrary, the age of
supreme psychical achievement.</p>

<p>Science and invention are for ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
annexing fresh regions of the universe
and subjecting them to the free play
of our mental faculties. The process
of bringing material things into subjection
to our will is a process of
sublimation, which does not drag us
down to the dust, but raises up dust
into the realms of immortal spirit.</p>

<p>At the time when the first man decided
to go forth into the world provided
with weapons not furnished by nature
(in other words, “unnatural”) the lines
of development adopted by nature
had ended in an <em>impasse</em>. Mere size
had been found ineffective, and the
giant Reptilians had disappeared from
the earth. The Mammoth and the
great Rorqual Whale were the largest
animals then in existence, and nature
had retraced her steps somewhat as
shipbuilding did in the nineteenth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
century after the building of the
<i>Great Eastern</i>. Of the countless forms
of animal and vegetable life, many
had disappeared entirely, being no
longer suited to climatic or other
changes of environment. There was
no prospect of higher development
unless an entirely new path could be
found. We may put the situation in
another way by paraphrasing an
ancient tribal account of the origin
of things:</p>

<p>“In the Beginning there was the
Sun and the Earth.</p>

<p>“And the Sun and the Earth said:
Let there be Life. And the Earth
covered itself with a living coat of
green, fed by the Sun.</p>

<p>“And the Earth said: Let there
be Moving Life. And Life began to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
Move about, fed by the Life that was
green and stood still.</p>

<p>“And the Earth said: Let there be
Man, and let him be fed by the Green
Life and the Moving Life, and let
him subdue all Life, and let him subdue
Me and serve Me and make Me
great in the Heavens.”</p>

<p>And so the Earth brought forth
Man, her latest and greatest Experiment.
For a long time he was a rather
inferior animal, but when he began to
throw stones and spears he launched
out on his true career, a career destined
to culminate in the complete mastery
of his native planet and the apotheosis
of the Earth.</p>

<p>The pre-human Animal had already
learned to use the world of plants for
purposes of nutrition, and to use the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
mineral world for dwelling purposes.
Improving upon the methods of his
predecessors, man made the land and
sea his province, and drew from it not
only nourishment but the means of
extending his dominion. “He that
hath, to him shall be given.” And
this extension became more and more
rapid. Living, as we do, in an age of
continually accelerated progress, we
find it difficult to realize its rapidity.</p>

<p>We are caught in a flood. From day
to day things are changing. What
we write to-day is obsolete to-morrow.
The clock ticks on the mantelpiece as
it did twenty years ago, but outside in
the road is the roar of motor traffic.
The clip-clop of the horses’ hooves is
no longer heard. Hephæstus has put
his fires into the interior of the motor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
engine, and found yet another way of
using sunlight accumulated in the
earth millions of years ago, instead of
relying upon the solar energy stored
in the grass eaten by the horse.</p>

<p>Fire has made all things new. We
are surrounded by its gifts. My pen
has passed through many fires before
it reached my hand. All round me are
traces of machinery and mechanism.
The paper on which I write is calendered
in the paper mills. I am aware
that it is not as lasting as “hand-made”
paper, and that it will not survive centuries
of use like Gutenberg’s bibles.
But what matter? If there is anything
worthy of survival in what I
write it will survive, even though it
may require to be cast in bronze. If
it is good it will be <i lang="la">aere perennius</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>Mankind may be likened to a vast
army on the march. It is preceded
by:</p>

<p>(1) Pathfinders, called explorers,
inventors, and discoverers, whose
business it is to find new avenues of
development and achievement.</p>

<p>Then come the</p>

<p>(2) Commanders with their staff of
Organizers. These direct and co-ordinate
the movements of the masses
in directions judged to be for the
general welfare. They are followed by</p>

<p>(3) The Rank and File, consisting
of those who live and work along accepted
and well-established lines in all
grades of society, taking no risks and
making no changes.</p>

<p>(4) The Stragglers, or those who
work for themselves alone, without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
reference to the needs and prospects
of the community. Among these must
be classed the squatters and backwoodsmen,
and small crofters and
peasants who grow their own food and
weave their own cloth. They do not
belong to civilized society, though
they do no harm to it and cannot quite
escape its influence.</p>

<p>(5) The Campfollowers and Vultures,
who have no regard for the
welfare of the community, but prey
upon it for their own ends.</p>

<p>Classes (1) and (2) are by far the
most important and valuable constituents
of the human race. They
are the growing element, the “cambium,”
the grey matter of the brain.
Whoever has sufficient originality to
strike out an original course, combined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
with loyalty to humanity at large or
to a smaller community; whoever is
capable of leadership, whether in war
or peace, art or commerce, industry or
politics; whoever can lead others
forward and inspire them with courage
to face difficulties—he belongs to the
<em>élite</em> of mankind, to whatever grade of
society he may belong. Far behind
his class come the rank and file of
commonplace drudges, who work in a
rut and submit to being led like sheep.
They may be clerks, domestic servants,
trade union operatives, pensioners, or
small investors. They form the large,
undistinguished, but useful mass of
humanity. Many kings have belonged
to this class.</p>

<p>Both the large capitalist and the
trade union boss I should class among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
the Commanders, and I should assign
them a high rank in human progressive
elements. The former is often a Pathfinder
in commerce and industry, and
the latter often points the way to the
betterment of manual workers. Both
are in a position of great power, but
are exposed to the temptation to
abuse it. The financier may succeed
in restricting the free market in an
important human community for his
own enrichment and aggrandizement.
The trade union boss may make a
“corner” in a certain form of labour
and so deprive the community of some
essential commodity, such as housing
accommodation. When this degeneration
takes place, both these types
must be put into the Vulture class.</p>

<p>The same judgment must be passed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
on those who use the machinery of
the medium of exchange to further
objects contrary to the interests of the
community, such as usurers, and purveyors
of intoxicant drugs. These also
are among the Vultures.</p>

<p>When the first armed man transferred
a method employed by nature
into a new medium, and derived his
armour from the outer world instead
of growing it in his own organism, he
took a step which led to many similar
re-interpretations. One of the most
important of such steps was Organization.
The very word recalls its
“organic” origin. The organs of the
human body form an interdependent
community with a common interest.
The organs again are composed of
tissues, and the tissues of individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
cells having, as many biologists believe,
a rudimentary consciousness of
their own. All these—some millions of
millions of millions—form a vast and
closely-organized community consisting
of many more distinct individuals
than there are human beings on earth.
The human race is such an organized
community. A swarm of bees is
another, but while the latter only
deals with “natural” food-supplies
and housing materials, the human
community, thanks primarily to the
use of fire, gathers its resources from
realms utterly inaccessible to the
ordinary animal, and establishes an
unassailable superiority. Thus the
human army, consisting of Pathfinders,
Organizers, Rank and File, and
Stragglers, with a trail of Vultures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
behind, presses ever forward on its
victorious march of progress.</p>

<p>Its general procedure may be
represented as follows:</p>

<p>The Pathfinders are in front, seeking
out new avenues of advance. They
may discover a new coal mine or oil
well or mineral deposit; a more
economical method of lighting and
heating; an improved method of
weaving or printing; a new medicine;
a new formula for expressing numerical
relations; an improved method of
transmitting news; or merely a
simplified method of mending socks.
Whatever it may be, the new discovery
is passed on to the organizers,
the captains of industry, the capitalists
and financiers, and the trade unions.
In a well-organized community, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
discovery or invention is given every
opportunity of proving its value.
Where vested interests and monopolies
stand in the way, either in the camp
of the capitalists and property holders
or in the ranks of labour, much opposition
may be encountered, and the
community may be deprived of the
advantages of the new discovery. But
if there is no such opposition, the
work incidental to the utilization of
the discovery is distributed by the
organizers among the rank and file,
consisting of mechanics, clerks, and
small investors. As soon as the industry
is successfully established, the
Vultures begin to hover round. Some
of them seek to drive the industry
into a corner where it can only exist by
serving the interests of the Vultures.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
Other Vultures endeavour to corner
the labour trained by the pathfinders
and pioneers and hold the new industry
to ransom. But in a well-organized
community these nefarious activities
are kept within bounds. The pathfinders,
the organizers, and the rank
and file are given their due credit and
reward, and the community reaps the
full benefit of the discovery.</p>

<p>And now let us examine the activities
of the Pathfinders. In classical
times the most audacious and renowned
of these were the Phœnicians, who,
armed with their shields and corselets
of “oak and triple bronze,” sailed
through the Pillars of Hercules out
from the tideless Mediterranean into
the unknown terrors of the Atlantic.
Their ships were seen in the Baltic,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
trading woven purple garments for
amber, and on the British coasts in
search of tin. At the request of an
Egyptian Pharao, they circumnavigated
Africa, and brought back wildly
improbable but, nevertheless, true
stories about new constellations and
the sun culminating in the north.</p>

<p>In Egypt itself explorers and discoverers
of another kind were busy.
The science of Chemistry was born
there, and named after “Chem,” the
native name of Egypt. In Greece and
its colonies the science of Geometry
attained a high standard, while Syracuse
stands out as the home of Archimedes,
one of the greatest mathematicians,
physicists, and inventors of
all time. These Pathfinders enriched
humanity with priceless gifts. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
surveyed the field of possible discovery
from a high altitude, and their clear
vision traced out the paths to higher
achievement, to be trodden by their
successors.</p>

<p>Had they lived in better-organized
communities, their labours would have
been turned to greater advantage, and
would have benefited a greater number
of their fellow men. But the day
of capitalism and mass-production had
not yet come. The splendid achievements
of an Archimedes only served
to benefit a tyrant, and his single-handed
scientific fight against the
Romans ended in disaster to his beloved
city.</p>

<p>In Greek and Roman days, owing
to the lop-sided organization of human
society, scientific discoveries could only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
benefit a few powerful people. The
downtrodden underlings were unaffected
by the work of the Pathfinders.
They had to await the dawn of
the Industrial Age before they could
take part in the progress of the <em>élite</em>.
Yet it must be put to the credit of the
Hieros, the Medicis, and the greater
of the Bourbon and Stuart Kings that
they fostered the advancement of
science and protected the Pathfinders
from the persecution of ecclesiastical
and other vultures.</p>

<p>The invention of gunpowder laid
low the chivalry of the Middle Ages.
The Hobbling God triumphed over
the mail-clad monopolist on horseback.
The Sudden Fire armed the
foot-soldier with a winged shaft of
death. The stone-thrower had became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
the unerring sharp-shooter. The range
of human power increased apace. The
glass-blower with his fiery furnace
produced cunning contrivances of glass
which increased the range of the human
eye twenty or thirty-fold. A free
philosopher like Spinoza could discourse
of the fundamental substance
without fear or favour, since the grinding
of optical glasses assured him an
independent livelihood. Then came
the French Revolution with its clarion
call to a wider organization of humanity,
which was eventually brought
about, not by speeches and pamphlets,
but by the harnessing of coal to inaugurate
the Mechanical Age.</p>

<p>The nineteenth century saw the fulfilment
of the dream of an organized
Humanity, a human world unified,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
not by the spread of humanitarian
philosophies, but by the material
bonds of progress.</p>

<p>Some of my critics have ridiculed
my “robust” belief in the reality of
progress through invention and the
use of machinery. I see no reason to
modify my view. A generation ago,
Ruskin deplored the spread of railways
which scored their lines through
“bleeding landscapes.” To me a railway
line is a thing of beauty, wherever
it may be found. It is a symbol of a
higher will and of a purpose transcending
the puny sphere of the individual.
To see the rails is as if the sinews and
muscles of some supernatural being
were made visible and accessible to me.
And who shall say that I am wrong in
that feeling? A railway <em>is</em> an organization<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
superior to man. “Societies,”
says Edward Carpenter,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> “not only
of bees (as Maeterlinck has shown),
but of all creatures up to man, have,
<i lang="la">qua</i> societies, a life of their own, inclusive
of and superadded to that of
their individual members.” And so a
railway appears to me as an individual
of a higher order, closely organized
and endowed with a life of its own.
Its mental equipment is its personnel,
its directors, clerks, drivers, guards
and porters. Its body consists of
rails, bridges, tunnels, stations and
rolling stock. It has a soul and a
living purpose. It has a power of
self-maintenance and self-preservation
and a rudimentary memory.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> <cite>The Art of Creation.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>I heartily sympathize with the child<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
who adores a locomotive engine. To
him, nothing could be more lavishly
fraught with beauty. I saw a little
while ago a powerful engine at Waterloo
Station at the head of an express
train for Bournemouth. It was a thing
of perfect and satisfying beauty. Its
lines suggested calmness and strength
and speed. The wisp of steam about
its safety valve spoke of well-controlled
powers within its massive
frame. The driver, a clear-eyed man
with trusty hands and sturdy body, was
a noble representative of Hephæstus.
One felt that the load of health-seeking
humanity behind him was in safe
hands, that his nerves and muscles
would work as perfectly as the engine
he regarded with such loving attention,
and that the 108 miles of the non-stop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
journey would be accomplished without
a hitch. The beneficent monster
lay there in the morning sun, ready to
spring forward on its swift trajectory
across the “bleeding landscape”! And
there are people who can look upon
the eager children in the train, armed
with their spades and buckets for playing
in the health-giving southern sunshine,
and deny the progressiveness of
the Mechanical Age!</p>

<p>They will probably argue, of course,
that if it were not for the smoke of
the city, due to the “fires of Hephæstus,”
there would be no necessity
to have trains to carry the children to
the seaside. But the smoke of cities
is due mainly to incomplete combustion
in domestic hearths, and the
remedy lies not in the discouragement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
of mechanical invention but in its
further extension until it provides us
with a smokeless city.</p>

<p>The fires of Hephæstus are fashioning
a new world. They are welding
humanity into a coherent mass. All
the metals, all the ninety chemical elements,
are being pressed into service.
Whose service? The service of a race
whose destiny we can as yet only
dimly appreciate. Already we command
temperatures varying from a
region within a few degrees of the
absolute zero to within a few hundred
degrees of the heat of the sun. The
sight of our eyes has been supplemented
to such an extent that we can
appreciate and deal with some fifteen
octaves of visible and invisible light
instead of the single octave “naturally”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
accessible to our sight. We command
pressures of tons per square millimetre
and degrees of vacuum down to a
hundred-millionth of an atmosphere.
We can photograph the track of a
single atom tearing its way through
moist air. We can print 500,000 copies
of a paper of 150,000 words daily and
sell it for a penny. We have banished
bears and wolves from our home
countries and have learnt to wage war
against invisible germs of disease. We
have acquired the power of bringing
beautiful music into the homes of our
humblest citizens. The luxuries of our
forbears are the common possessions
of our own generation. If we are not
happier than our ancestors, the fault
lies in ourselves, in our ingratitude
and lack of imagination. Or must we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
conclude that happiness is a negligible
thing in the great scheme of progress,
and that that scheme does not concern
itself with our individual feelings?</p>

<p>I for one believe that happiness is
on the up-grade, too. Hephæstus is
not only a strong and a clever god, but
a god with a sense of humour and a
very lovable character.</p>

<p>The empire of Hephæstus is expanding
before our eyes. His bellows blow
through our blast furnaces. His
anvils ring in thousands of factories.
His engines career over the land, and
his steamers over the sea. His internal-combustion
cars are strung out along
the roadways, and his avions run their
furrows through the clouds. Wherever
he goes, he lightens the burdens of
humanity and gladdens all hearts with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
his gifts. He brings warmth and light
into dark places. He draws mankind
closer and closer together. He draws
them together without diminishing the
distance between them. He simply
makes that distance impotent to hold
them apart. He enables the city children
to leave their slums and gather
fresh health in the open country. He
gives the grimed city worker fresh
clear air wherein to sleep. His lorries,
thundering along the highways, tighten
the bonds between the farmer who
gathers the fruit and the town dweller
who consumes it.</p>

<p>Nor is Hephæstus satisfied yet. His
task is but half finished. The whole
earth must be Vulcanized.</p>

<p>The God of Fire and of Iron hobbles
over the broad earth, seeking and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
finding new paths of advancement towards
a better and fuller life.</p>

<p>Man has become less and less limited
by his permanent organism, that Body
which in the beginning was all he
possessed. He has now as many
different shapes as ever Proteus had,
and he can assume any of them at will.
At one time he has the shape of a
rowing boat, his arms prolonged seven
feet or more till his blades skim the
water. Again, his legs will be two
wheels, and his body will be like those
steeds with fire-breathing nostrils
which Hephæstus made for the King
of Colchis. Again, the pupil of his eye
will grow until its diameter measures
100 inches and then he will sound the
depths of the heavens with the power
of 100,000 eyes in one. When he goes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
to war, he throws his “stone” some
seventy miles and arms it with vast
destruction. He belches forth deadly
vapours which choke and strangle his
enemies. He becomes an armed slug
creeping over all obstacles and destroying
as he creeps.</p>

<p>In times of peace he dresses in various
garbs to suit his changing occupation.
His womenfolk emphasize and
glorify their variety of personal presentation
and expression. Protea shines
in all the colours and shades of the rainbow,
and invents new colours and new
forms every day, forms of dress, of
outline, and of her very bodily figure.</p>

<p>The resignations and renunciations
of former ages are forgotten. Music,
travel, pictures, education—the
luxuries of past generations are the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
common property of all to-day. That
is the sort of Communism which is
feasible and reasonable. Take all the
luxuries and good things of this life
and bring them within reach of all by
cheapening their cost of production.
Travel at a pound a mile is a luxury.
Travel at a penny a mile becomes a
“necessity” as soon as people get used
to it and take it for granted.</p>

<p>Security and seclusion are privileges
cherished by what used to be called
the “aristocrats.” Place both within
reach of the masses by insurance and
by transport facilities. Make all these
luxuries and privileges common property.
It is not so many centuries ago
that a mariner’s compass was bartered
for diamonds. To-day it costs a penny.
And then we come upon a difficulty.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
When a thing becomes common property,
or so cheap as to be of practically
no price, it ceases to be coveted. There
is a tendency deep-rooted in the human
heart to reach out beyond the
things of to-day for something not yet
attained. When Communism has
shared out the earth, it will ask for
the moon. Humanity will never assume
a “dead level of mediocrity.”
There will always be the Thyroid
Type, energetic, inquisitive, sensitive,
inventive, and restless. The class of
Pathfinders will be recruited from that
type. The Pituitary Type will furnish
commanders and organizers, while the
Adrenal Type will furnish the rank
and file. But the intermixture of the
various types will bring out special
constitutions and varieties in unexpected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
quarters, and it behoves us to
keep “<i lang="fr">la carrière ouverte aux talents</i>.”</p>

<p>Thus the human army will march
forward, led by a Pillar of Fire. Its
pace will be constantly accelerated, but
we shall hardly be aware of it, for
our methods of measuring time will
change in the same ratio. A well-made
motor-car on a smooth road can hum
along sweetly at sixty miles an hour,
and its occupants will be less impressed
and excited than they would be by the
horse careering at 20 miles per hour!
And what are all these speeds to the
absolutely smooth planetary speed of
nineteen miles per second!</p>

<p>It has been asserted that the tremendous
powers conferred upon man by
machinery have produced the terrific
wars of recent times by placing power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
in the wrong hands. There may be
some justice in this, but the amount of
destruction is negligible in comparison
with the amount of construction and
reparation. When Kitchener saved a
few hundred casualties at Paardeberg
by sparing his men, he lost 10,000 at
Bloemfontein by enteric fever. The
bloodiest war is sometimes the least
costly on balance. The greatest war
of all history ended but seven years
ago, and already the beaten nations
have healed up their wounds and are
looking forward to the future with
greater confidence than many of the
“victorious” nations. Mankind is increasing
the rapidity of its nervous
reaction to emergencies and injuries.
The leucocytes of the body politic set
to work sooner and more effectively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
to heal the damage. Mankind as an
organism is daily improving its circulatory
system, <em>alias</em> its transport
facilities. Its nervous system closely
imitates organic nerves by its cables
and land-lines, and it improves upon
nature by adding wireless communication
and resonance to the organic devices
of the body.</p>

<p>Mankind is being moulded into a
single compact self-contained body on
the anvil of Hephæstus. It is still
subject to feverish ailments and some
chronic diseases. But the general outlines
of future development are clearly
discernible. There must be pauses and
set-backs. The brilliant scientific and
artistic development of classical Hellenism
was all but lost in the destruction
of the Roman civilization. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
the Arabs kept the flickering flame
alive until Europe awoke from its torpor
and lit its torch once more. Since
then there has been no turning back.
The age of science, discovery, and
invention, the age of mechanism and
machinery and power, has come and
come to stay. Man, liberated from
mechanical drudgery by the machine,
has time to develop his intellectual
and artistic powers. His necessities
being supplied by pressing a button, he
is liberated to enjoy a more varied
existence. If some men and women
are still bound to monotonous tasks,
it does not necessarily mean unhappiness,
for the Pathfinders’ life is one
of constant care and much anxiety.
Discovery is 90 per cent. failure, and
something like a daily routine of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
regular and monotonous work sometimes
appears in the light of a blissful
refuge. Besides, the human heart and
organism easily falls into a routine in
which daily work is hardly felt, being
done without conscious effort. This
fact is often forgotten by those who
envy the life of the organizer and
financier, which is one of much risk
and anxiety, relieved by an occasional
big prize.</p>

<p>The ideal state of things would be
attained if those of an adventurous
disposition could be given the adventurous
part of human activity, and if
those who are plodders by nature
could be left to do the plodding.</p>

<p>That is a matter for future development,
either consciously fostered by
wise leaders of our race, or unconsciously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
evolved from the depths of
wisdom hidden below the threshold of
the racial consciousness.</p>

<p>But the goal is in sight. The earth
is being organized and unified under
the ægis of the human race, the protoplasm
of this planet, the race which,
transcending the mechanism and long-established
traditions of its own germ-plasm,
enlarged and multiplied its
functions until it acquired the use of,
fire. Upon that achievement it built
an unprecedented form of life, a
super-“natural” edifice of infinite
power, as yet but dimly realized, but
which in its full beauty and perfection
will be nothing less than Divine.</p>
